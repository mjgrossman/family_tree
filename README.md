# Family tree

This is a command-line app to track a family tree. It's an exercise in using Active Record without Rails, and playing around with associations that aren't always straightforward.


Features:

* Tracking children
* Reporting parents
* Reporting siblings, cousins, uncles/aunts, etc.
* Tracking divorces
